BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM EXPLANATION
================================

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. Here's how it works:

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Compare adjacent elements - Starting from the first element, compare it with the next element
2. Swap if necessary - If the first element is greater than the second, swap them
3. Move to next pair - Move to the next pair of elements and repeat
4. Complete pass - After one complete pass through the array, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end
5. Repeat - Continue this process until the entire array is sorted

VISUAL EXAMPLE:
Original array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

Pass 1: [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]  (64 bubbles up)
Pass 2: [25, 12, 22, 11, 34, 64, 90]  (34 bubbles up)
Pass 3: [12, 22, 11, 25, 34, 64, 90]  (25 bubbles up)
Pass 4: [12, 11, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]  (22 bubbles up)
Pass 5: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]  (12 bubbles up)
Pass 6: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]  (no swaps needed)

TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Best Case: O(n) - when array is already sorted
- Average Case: O(n²) - most common scenario
- Worst Case: O(n²) - when array is reverse sorted

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- O(1) - only uses a constant amount of extra space

ADVANTAGES:
- Simple to understand and implement
- Stable sorting algorithm (maintains relative order of equal elements)
- In-place sorting (doesn't require extra memory)

DISADVANTAGES:
- Very inefficient for large datasets
- O(n²) complexity makes it impractical for production use
- Many other algorithms (like quicksort, mergesort) are much faster

WHEN TO USE:
- Educational purposes
- Small datasets (n < 50)
- When simplicity is more important than efficiency
- When stable sorting is required and memory is limited

Bubble sort is great for learning sorting concepts but should generally be avoided in real-world applications where performance matters.
