# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for implementing classic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.  
This project is a work-in-progress and will gradually grow to include a wide variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms with clean, readable code.

## 📁 Structure

Each problem or concept is stored in a separate Java file. Files are named clearly, such as:

- `Problem_1.java` — Implementation of the **Linked List ADT** with basic operations like insertion, deletion, size, and traversal.
- `Problem_1_ArrayList.java` — Menu-driven program to perform various **ArrayList operations** such as insertion, deletion, search, update, reverse, and more.

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository

- Practice and reinforce DSA concepts in Java  
- Build reusable code snippets for competitive programming and interviews  
- Share clean, commented implementations for learners and contributors  

## ✅ Current Topics

- [x] Singly Linked List (`Problem_1`)  
  - Operations: insert at end, insert at beginning, remove first, size, print  
- [x] ArrayList Operations (`Problem_1_ArrayList`)  
  - Menu-driven program: insertion, deletion, search, update, reverse, display, size, clear  

## 🛠️ Upcoming Topics

- [ ] Stack and Queue (Array & Linked List implementation)  
- [ ] Doubly Linked List  
- [ ] Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)  
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)  
- [ ] Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)  
- [ ] Graphs and their traversal (DFS, BFS)  
- [ ] Recursion and Backtracking  

## 📚 Language Used

- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
