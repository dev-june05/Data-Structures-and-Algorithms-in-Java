#  Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for implementing classic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.  
This project is a work-in-progress and will gradually grow to include a wide variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms with clean, readable code.

##  Structure

Each problem or concept is stored in a separate Java file. Files are named clearly, such as:

- `Problem_1.java` â€” Implementation of the **Linked List ADT** with basic operations like insertion, deletion, size, and traversal.

##  Goals of this Repository

- Practice and reinforce DSA concepts in Java
- Build reusable code snippets for competitive programming and interviews
- Share clean, commented implementations for learners and contributors

##  Current Topics

- [x] Singly Linked List (`Problem_1`)

##  Upcoming Topics

- [ ] Stack and Queue (Array & Linked List implementation)
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- [ ] Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- [ ] Graphs and their traversal (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] Recursion and Backtracking

##  Language Used

- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)

##  Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or want to contribute another DSA problem, feel free to fork and open a PR.
