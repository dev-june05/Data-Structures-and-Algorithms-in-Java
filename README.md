# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for implementing classic **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.  
This project is a work-in-progress that will gradually grow to include a wide variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms, with clean, readable code.

##  Structure

Each data structure or algorithm is implemented in its own Java file. Current files include:

- `Problem_1.java` — **Linked List ADT** implementation: insertion (end & beginning), removal of first node, size calculation, and traversal.
- `Problem_1_ArrayList.java` — **ArrayList operations (interactive)**: insertion, deletion, search, update, reverse, display, size, clear.
- `ImplementationStack.java` — Basic **Stack** implementation.
- `ImplementationQueue.java` — Basic **Queue** implementation.
- `StackusingLL.java` — **Stack using Linked List** approach.

##  Goals of this Repository

- Practice and reinforce DSA concepts in Java  
- Build reusable code snippets for competitive programming and interviews  
- Provide clean, commented implementations for learners and contributors  

##  Current Topics

- [x] **Singly Linked List** (`Problem_1.java`)  
  - Operations: insert at end, insert at beginning, remove first, size, print  
- [x] **ArrayList Operations** (`Problem_1_ArrayList.java`)  
  - Interactive menu: insertion, deletion, search, update, reverse, display, size, clear  
- [x] **Stack** (`ImplementationStack.java`)  
- [x] **Queue** (`ImplementationQueue.java`)  
- [x] **Stack using Linked List** (`StackusingLL.java`)  


##  Language Used

- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
