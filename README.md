📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for implementing classic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java.
This repository serves as a hands-on learning space to practice, understand, and master the fundamental data structures and algorithms essential for coding interviews, competitive programming, and academic learning.

📂 Repository Structure

Each topic or algorithm is implemented in its own Java file for modularity and clarity.
Some algorithms also include a corresponding .txt file explaining the logic, complexity, or dry run.
